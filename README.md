ðŸŽ¬ MovieFlix Recommender: Keeping Users Hooked with Machine Learning
Welcome to the MovieFlix Recommender project! In the ever-evolving world of OTT platforms, captivating your audience with spot-on movie suggestions is the secret sauce to user retention. This project leverages the power of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to deliver context-based movie recommendations using a vectorization technique called Bag of Words (BoW).

Project Overview
Our mission? To create a seamless, addictive user experience on MovieFlix by suggesting movies that resonate with our users' tastes. Using a meticulously crafted fake dataset that mirrors real-world data, we build a robust recommendation system that can be implemented in any OTT platform to keep the binge-watching streak alive.

Features
Bag of Words Vectorization: Transform movie descriptions into numerical data that machines can understand.
Cosine Similarity: Measure the similarity between movies to recommend those with a comparable vibe.

How It Works
Data Collection: We simulate a dataset with movie titles, genres, descriptions, and other relevant information to mimic a real-world scenario.
Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the movie descriptions, removing stop words and applying stemming.
Vectorization: Convert the text data into vectors using the Bag of Words model.
Similarity Calculation: Compute cosine similarity between movie vectors to find similar movies.
Recommendation: Suggest movies based on the highest similarity scores.
